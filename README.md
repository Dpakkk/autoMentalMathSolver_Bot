# autoMentalMathSolver_Bot
I was preparing for Quantative Trading exam for one trading firm. The cut-off point was 60 arithmetic answers in just 120 seconds. So instead, before the exam night, I made a bot to solve that arithmetic problem itself from https://arithmetic.zetamac.com/ website. You can add your webistes if you want. With this bot, I can easily achieve a score of 400+ within the given time limit. 

P.S: Exam was in Hackerrank using this bot there was impossible at least for now. I didn't use bot for my final exam just made this bot out of curiousity.
